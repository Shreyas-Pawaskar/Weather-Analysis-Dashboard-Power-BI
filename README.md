🌦️ Weather Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Data Visualization

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize weather patterns and climate data. The dashboard provides clear insights into temperature trends, humidity variations, rainfall distribution, and seasonal comparisons across different regions.

Key Contributions:

Cleaned and transformed raw weather data using Power Query for accuracy and consistency.

Applied DAX functions to calculate averages, year-over-year comparisons, and dynamic metrics.

Designed interactive visuals and slicers for region-wise and time-based exploration.

Created a user-friendly layout highlighting temperature variation, rainfall intensity, and humidity analysis through engaging charts and KPIs.

This project demonstrates my ability to convert raw environmental data into actionable insights, leveraging Power BI for data-driven decision-making and visual storytelling.
